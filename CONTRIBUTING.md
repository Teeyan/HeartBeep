# Ideas for Contribution

Head over to our README to see a small list of features we originally wanted to implement and still would like to see as an integral
part of HeartBeep in the near future!

There are various ways you can help out!

**Front-End** - We'd love for some front-end monoliths to help out and create a UI that is aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for an older or less tech savvy demographic!

**Twilio** - We really want to dig deeper into the Twilio API, so all you adventurous contributors out there should look for inovative ways to utilize Twilio to its full potential.

**Google Cloud Voice** - Voice Recognition would be an incredible boon for HeartBeep! Explore the API and create something truly fantastic!

This project was purely altruistic and all of our contributors sincerely hope that anyone interested in helping would do so with that in mind. Be courteous to others and just act like a decent human being!
